# 1584 Design Inventory Management - Deployment & Domain Issues

## Overview
This document tracks all deployment, domain configuration, and caching issues encountered during the development and deployment of the 1584 Design Inventory Management system.

## Current Status
- ✅ **SUCCESS**: `https://1584-inventory.pages.dev/` - Working correctly
- ❌ **FAILURE**: `inventory.1584design.com` - Not serving updated content despite configuration

---

## Issue Timeline & Resolution Attempts

### Issue 1: PWA Disabled in Development (RESOLVED ✅)
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Problem**: PWA was disabled in development mode, preventing proper testing of production behavior
**Error Messages**:
- PWA service worker not registering in development
- Inconsistent behavior between dev and prod environments

**Root Cause**: `devOptions: { enabled: false }` in `vite.config.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// REMOVED this line from vite.config.ts:
devOptions: {
  enabled: false // Disable in development to avoid caching issues
}
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - PWA now works in both dev and prod

---

### Issue 2: Aggressive Caching Preventing Updates (RESOLVED ✅)
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Problem**: 7-day cache expiration preventing users from seeing updates
**Error Messages**:
- Users seeing old versions of code
- Changes not reflected even after hard refresh

**Root Cause**: Cache expiration set to 7 days in `vite.config.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// CHANGED in vite.config.ts:
maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 7 days for app files
// TO:
maxAgeSeconds: 60 // 1 minute for app files - see changes immediately
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Changes now visible within 1 minute

### Issue 3: BudgetProgress Component Export Error (RESOLVED ✅)
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Problem**: `BudgetProgress.js` couldn't import component 'B' from index.js
**Error Messages**:
```
SyntaxError: The requested module './index.js' does not provide an export named 'B'
```

**Root Cause**: Built `index.js` was exporting budget categories enum as 'B' instead of BudgetProgress component

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// CHANGED in dist/assets/index.js:
export{yi as B, ...}
// TO:
export{BudgetProgress as B, ...}
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - BudgetProgress component now properly exported

---

### Issue 4: Firebase Authentication Type Error (RESOLVED ✅)
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Problem**: `Expected type 'Ae', but it was: a custom X_ object` in non-incognito windows
**Error Messages**:
```
FirebaseError: Expected type 'Ae', but it was: a custom X_ object
```

**Root Cause**: Corrupted Firebase authentication cache in browser localStorage/sessionStorage

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added automatic cache clearing on Firebase initialization
2. Enhanced error handling for auth persistence failures
3. Improved Firebase initialization order

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Firebase auth errors eliminated

---

### Issue 5: Custom Domain Not Serving Updated Content (PENDING ❌)
**Date**: October 2, 2025 - ONGOING
**Problem**: `inventory.1584design.com` serves old content while `1584-inventory.pages.dev` works correctly
**Current Status**:
- ✅ Cloudflare Pages deployment working
- ✅ pages.dev URL serving latest version
- ❌ Custom domain serving outdated version

**Previous Attempts**:
1. ✅ Added custom domain in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. ✅ Added CNAME record to DNS provider
3. ✅ Configured SSL certificate
4. ❌ Still serving old content

**Potential Causes**:
1. **DNS Propagation**: CNAME record may not have fully propagated
2. **Cloudflare Pages Cache**: Edge cache serving old version
3. **SSL/Certificate Issues**: Certificate provisioning problems
4. **Configuration Mismatch**: Settings not properly applied

**Debugging Steps Taken**:
1. ✅ Verified CNAME record exists and points to correct pages.dev URL
2. ✅ Checked Cloudflare Pages custom domain configuration
3. ✅ Verified SSL certificate status
4. ❌ Issue persists

---

## Current Architecture

### Deployment Setup
- **Platform**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Build Tool**: Vite + TypeScript
- **Framework**: React + React Router
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)

### Domain Configuration
- **Primary URL**: `https://1584-inventory.pages.dev/` ✅ Working
- **Custom Domain**: `inventory.1584design.com` ❌ Not working
- **DNS Provider**: [Unknown - needs verification]

### Current Cache Strategy
- **App Files**: 1-minute cache (NetworkFirst)
- **Images**: 5-minute cache (CacheFirst)
- **Static Assets**: Long-term cache with immutable headers

---

## Next Steps for Custom Domain Resolution

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Verify DNS Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Check current DNS records
   nslookup inventory.1584design.com
   dig CNAME inventory.1584design.com
   ```

2. **Check Cloudflare Pages Configuration**
   - Verify custom domain is "Active" in dashboard
   - Check SSL certificate status
   - Verify deployment settings

3. **Force Cache Invalidation**
   - Purge Cloudflare Pages cache
   - Clear browser cache
   - Test in incognito mode

### If Issue Persists

4. **Advanced Debugging**
   - Check Cloudflare Analytics for domain traffic
   - Verify SSL certificate chain
   - Check for mixed content issues
   - Verify CORS headers

5. **Alternative Solutions**
   - Temporarily use pages.dev URL
   - Set up redirect from custom domain to pages.dev
   - Investigate Cloudflare DNS vs third-party DNS issues

---

## Known Workarounds

### Temporary Solution
- Use `https://1584-inventory.pages.dev/` for production access
- Update any bookmarks/links to use the working URL

### Development Solution
- All development should use `https://1584-inventory.pages.dev/`
- Custom domain configuration can be addressed post-deployment

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Cache Headers Matter**: Conflicting cache settings between wrangler.toml and _headers caused confusion
2. **Domain Setup Complexity**: Custom domain configuration in Cloudflare Pages requires multiple steps and verification
3. **Firebase Cache Issues**: Browser-stored Firebase cache can cause authentication errors
4. **PWA Configuration**: Disabling PWA in development prevents proper testing

---

## Future Recommendations

1. **Domain Setup Checklist**
   - Document complete domain setup process
   - Include DNS propagation timing expectations
   - Add verification steps for each configuration

2. **Deployment Improvements**
   - Implement automated deployment verification
   - Add health checks for both domains
   - Set up monitoring for domain availability

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Add Firebase cache clearing to build process
   - Implement automated cache invalidation
   - Add domain health checks to CI/CD pipeline
