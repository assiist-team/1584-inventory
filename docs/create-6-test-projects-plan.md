# Plan: Create 6 Test Projects in Account 2d612868-852e-4a80-9d02-9d10383898d4

## Overview
Create 6 diverse interior design projects with realistic data including:
- Project metadata (name, description, client name, budget, design fee)
- Project budget categories (JSONB) - **PARTIALLY ALLOCATED, NOT FULLY FILLED**
- Project main images
- Multiple transactions per project (each with category_id)
- Items tied to transactions (via transaction_id)
- Transaction totals should partially fill budget categories, NOT completely fill them

**Budget Reference**: Based on review of existing projects in the account, budgets range from $132K-$160K with design fees averaging 24-25% of budget. This plan includes projects in the $105K-$160K range (within +/- 20% of real projects) to match realistic scale.

**Key Points**:
- Budget categories are set in `projects.budget_categories` JSONB
- Transactions drive spending and fill budget categories
- Items are created WITH transactions (transaction_id links them)
- Budget categories should show PARTIAL progress (e.g., 30-60% spent), not 100%

## Account Details
- **Account ID**: `2d612868-852e-4a80-9d02-9d10383898d4`
- **Created By User ID**: `4ef35958-597c-4aea-b99e-1ef62352a72d` (from existing test data)

## SQL Seed Scripts
All seed scripts now live in `scripts/create-test-projects/`, and each file inserts exactly one project (plus its transactions and items). Run whichever project(s) you need via the Supabase MCP `execute_sql` tool.

- `project-1-modern-minimalist-apartment.sql` – downtown apartment refresh with clean furnishings
- `project-2-coastal-family-home.sql` – coastal family home with layered textiles and mixed vendors
- `project-3-industrial-loft-conversion.sql` – industrial loft with reclaimed woods and metals
- `project-4-traditional-elegance-estate.sql` – traditional estate with formal entertaining spaces
- `project-5-scandinavian-studio.sql` – compact Scandinavian studio with light woods
- `project-6-bohemian-eclectic-loft.sql` – colorful bohemian loft with global influences

**Note**: Item `images` arrays are intentionally left empty in every script to avoid storing brittle third-party URLs while still allowing the app to upload media later.

## Implementation Structure

### How Budget Categories Work
1. **Projects have budget_categories JSONB** - Defines the TOTAL budget allocation per category
   - Example: `{"designFee": 12500, "furnishings": 30000, "install": 5000}` means $12.5K design fee, $30K furnishings, $5K install
   - Categories sum to total budget (including design fee)
   - These are TARGETS, not current spending

2. **Transactions drive spending** - Each transaction has a `category_id` that links to `budget_categories`
   - Transaction amounts accumulate per category
   - Budget progress = (sum of transaction amounts in category) / (budget_categories[category])
   - Should show PARTIAL progress (30-60%), NOT 100%

3. **Items are tied to transactions** - Items have `transaction_id` that links them to a transaction
   - Items are created WITH transactions
   - Items don't directly affect budget categories - transactions do
   - Item `project_price` values sum to transaction `amount` (approximately)

### Example Flow
- Project budget: $110K
- Budget categories: `{"designFee": 27500, "furnishings": 68000, "install": 5000}`
- Transaction 1: $18,500 in "Furnishings" category → Furnishings: $18,500 / $68,000 = 27% spent
- Transaction 2: $13,200 in "Furnishings" category → Furnishings: $31,700 / $68,000 = 47% spent
- Transaction 3: $7,300 in "Install" category → Install: $7,300 / $5,000 = 146% spent (over budget)
- Total spent: $39,000 (35% of total budget) - **PARTIALLY FILLED**

---

## Implementation Notes

### Tax Rate
- Use standard tax rate: **10.0%** (stored as `10.0` in `tax_rate_pct` field)
- Calculate `tax_amount_purchase_price` = `purchase_price * tax_rate_pct / 100.0`
- Calculate `tax_amount_project_price` = `project_price * tax_rate_pct / 100.0`
- Store tax amounts as strings with 4 decimal places (e.g., `"45.0000"`)

### Item ID Format
- Format: `I-{timestamp}-{random}`
- Example: `I-1734489600000-a3f2`

### QR Key Format
- Format: `QR-{timestamp}-{random}`
- Example: `QR-1734489600000-x9k1`

### Transaction Creation
- Each project should have MULTIPLE transactions (2-4 transactions per project)
- Each transaction should have a `category_id` linking to `budget_categories`
- Transactions should PARTIALLY fill budget categories (aim for 30-60% spent per category)
- Transaction type: `'Purchase'`
- Status: `'completed'`
- Payment method: `'Client Card'`
- Transaction `amount` should approximately equal sum of item `project_price` values (plus tax)
- Use `category_id` UUID from budget_categories table, NOT the legacy `budget_category` text field

### Image URLs
- Project hero images still reference Unsplash photo IDs at 800x600 resolution
- Item image URLs are intentionally omitted from both the plan and SQL scripts

### Price Normalization
For items with multiple prices (purchase, project, market):
- `purchase_price` = LEAST(purchase, project, market)
- `market_value` = GREATEST(purchase, project, market)
- `project_price` = purchase + project + market - purchase_price - market_value

### Inventory Status
- All items should have `inventory_status` = `'allocated'` (since they're assigned to projects)
- `business_inventory_location` should be `NULL` for project items

### Date Fields
- `date_created`: Use `current_date` (today's date)
- `created_at`: Use `now()` (current timestamp)
- `last_updated`: Use `now()` (current timestamp)

---

## SQL Implementation Strategy

1. **Get Budget Category IDs**
   - Query `budget_categories` table for account to get category UUIDs
   - Store mapping: category name → UUID

2. **Create Projects First**
   - Insert all 6 projects with their metadata and `budget_categories` JSONB
   - Store project IDs for later use

3. **Create Transactions (Multiple per project)**
   - Create 2-4 transactions per project
   - Each transaction has `category_id` linking to budget category
   - Calculate transaction totals from item prices (sum of project_price + tax)
   - Transactions should PARTIALLY fill budgets (30-60% spent)

4. **Create Items WITH Transactions**
   - Insert items with `transaction_id` linking to the transaction
   - Items are created as part of transaction creation
   - Leave item `images` JSONB arrays empty in this seed data; upload real media later
   - Calculate tax amounts

5. **Update Project Counts**
   - Update `item_count` and `transaction_count` on projects
   - Update `total_value` on projects (sum of item project_price values)

---

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan for accuracy
2. Run whichever `scripts/create-test-projects/project-*.sql` files you need through the Supabase MCP `execute_sql` tool
3. Verify data in database
4. Test in application UI

---

## Image Sources

Project hero images are sourced from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com), which provides free, high-quality stock photos. Item-level images are omitted in this dataset; upload or link real assets later as needed.

**Note**: In production, images would typically be uploaded to Supabase Storage or a CDN. For this test data we keep only the project-level Unsplash URLs for quick reference.
