# 1584 Design

A modern, mobile-first inventory management application built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Supabase

1. Go to [Supabase Console](https://app.supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the following services:
   - **PostgreSQL Database** (automatically enabled)
   - **Authentication** (enable Google OAuth provider)
   - **Storage** (for images)
   - **Realtime** (for real-time updates)

#### 🔧 Configure Supabase Storage

1. **Create Storage Buckets:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:storage
   ```

2. **Configure CORS** (if needed):
   - Go to Storage > Settings in Supabase Dashboard
   - Configure CORS settings for your domain

3. **Get your Supabase configuration:**
   - Go to Project Settings > API
   - Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

### 3. Update Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase configuration:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**Where to find these values:**
- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to **Project Settings > API**
- Copy the **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

### 4. Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Apply database migrations
# Migrations are located in supabase/migrations/
# Apply them through Supabase Dashboard or CLI
```

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### 6. Deploy to Production

The application is configured for deployment with Cloudflare Pages or similar static hosting:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy the dist/ directory to your hosting provider
```

```

### Development Guidelines

1. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile (320px+) first, then scale up
2. **Component Structure**: Use functional components with TypeScript
3. **State Management**: Use React Context and Zustand for global state
4. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
5. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG AA guidelines
6. **Database**: Use Supabase Postgres with Row Level Security (RLS)

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

- Touch-friendly interfaces (44px minimum touch targets)
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Optimized images for different screen densities
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Project-focused navigation for mobile workflows

## 🔒 Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Authentication with Supabase Auth (Google OAuth)
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS-only hosting
- Account-based multi-user support

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is configured for deployment with Cloudflare Pages or similar static hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

### Deploy

Upload the `dist/` directory to your hosting provider:

- **Cloudflare Pages**: Connect your repository and set build command to `npm run build`
- **Vercel**: Connect your repository - Vercel will auto-detect Vite
- **Netlify**: Connect your repository and set build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `dist`

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public key

**Important:** These are public environment variables that will be embedded in your client-side bundle. The anon key is safe to expose as it's designed for client-side use and respects Row Level Security policies.

### Cloudflare Pages Configuration

The project includes `wrangler.toml` for Cloudflare Pages deployment. The build process is configured to:
- Build with Node.js 18
- Output to `dist/` directory
- Set appropriate headers for security and caching

## 📊 Performance

- **Lighthouse Score**: Target 90+ for all categories
- **Core Web Vitals**: All metrics in "Good" range
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized for fast loading
- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient Supabase Realtime subscriptions
